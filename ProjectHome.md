The project is all about experimenting with AI and genetic programming concepts.
It includes a simple game where you place pipe tiles.
There is also an interpreter for a small lisp that can talk to the game.
Finally there is a genetic programming system that produces programs in that simple lisp that play the game. Badly, as it turns out.

It was meant more as test bed for learning about AI, lisp and genetic programming, but I'm putting it out there so people can play with it if they want to.

To give it a try, you can download it [here](http://pipevo.googlecode.com/files/pipevo.jar).

The AI menu provides a collection of hand coded 'AIs' and helper logic that play the game.

From the run menu you can launch the interpreter, run an AI in batch mode, or attempt to evolve a program do one of the following:
  1. Evaluate the function x^2 + 2x
  1. Play the game
  1. Play the game, but don't include the function that follows the pipe from the source.
