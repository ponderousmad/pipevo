# pipevo

The project is all about experimenting with AI and genetic programming concepts. It includes a simple game where you place pipe tiles. There is also an interpreter for a small lisp that can talk to the game. Finally there is a genetic programming system that produces programs in that simple lisp that play the game. Badly, as it turns out.

It was meant more as test bed for learning about AI, lisp and genetic programming, but I'm putting it out there so people can [play with it if they want to](https://ponderousmad.com/pipevo/game.html).

Buttons below the game run various hand coded 'AIs' and helper logic that play the game.

Next is an interpreter, where you can evaluate programs written in simple lisp dialect.

Finally you can attempt to evolve lisp programs that either attempt to approximate the function x^2 + 2x or play the game.
